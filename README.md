## Predicting fraud in the Enron corruption scandal

In this project, I use machine learning to predict 'person of interest' status in the Enron corruption scandal, drawing on data from the Enron corpus dataset. I perform feature engineering, outlier detection and removal, automated feature selection, automated hyper-parameter tuning, and other techniques. The project is coded in Python, and works mostly in the sklearn and pandas modules.
